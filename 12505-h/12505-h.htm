    <h3>PERIPLUS OF HANNO THE CARTHAGINIAN.</h3>

    <p>I am not sufficiently Quixotic to attempt a defence of the
    Carthaginians on the western coast of Africa, or any where
    else, but I submit that the accusation brought against them by
    Mr. S. Bannister, formerly Attorney-General of New South Wales,
    is not sustained by the only record we possess of Hanno's
    colonising expedition. That gentleman, in his learned
    <i>Records of British Enterprise beyond Sea</i>, just
    published, says, in a note, p. xlvii.:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"The first nomade tribe they reached was friendly, and
    furnished Hanno with <i>interpreters</i>. At length they
    discovered a nation <i>whose language was unknown to the
    interpreters</i>. These strangers they attempted to seize; and,
    upon their resistance, they took three of the women, whom they
    put to death, and carried their skins to Carthage" (<i>Geogr.
    Gr&aelig;ci Minores</i>, Paris, 1826, p. 115.).</p>

    <p>Hanno obtained interpreters from a people who dwelt on the
    banks of a large river, called the Lixus, and supposed to be
    the modern St. Cyprian. Having sailed thence for several days,
    and touched at different places, planting a colony in one of
    them, he came to a mountainous country inhabited by savages,
    who wore skins of wild beasts,
    &delta;&epsilon;&rho;&mu;&alpha;&tau;&alpha;
    &theta;&eta;&rho;&epsilon;&iota;&alpha;
    &epsilon;&nu;&eta;&mu;&mu;&epsilon;&nu;&omega;&nu;. At a
    distance of twelve days' sail he came to some Ethiopians, who
    could not endure the Carthaginians, and who spoke
    unintelligibly even to the Lixite interpreters. These are the
    people whose women, Mr. Bannister says, they killed. Hanno
    sailed from this inhospitable coast fifteen days, and came to a
    gulf which he calls &Nu;&omicron;&tau;&omicron;&upsilon;
    &Kappa;&epsilon;&rho;&alpha;, or South Horn.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Here," says the Dr. Hawkesworth, of Carthage, "in the
        gulf, was an island, like the former, containing a lake,
        and in this another island, full of wild men; but the women
        were much more numerous, <i>with hairy bodies</i>
        (&delta;&alpha;&sigma;&epsilon;&iota;&alpha;&iota;
        &tau;&omicron;&iota;&sigma;
        &sigma;&omega;&mu;&alpha;&sigma;&iota;&nu;), whom the
        interpreters called
        &gamma;&omicron;&rho;&iota;&lambda;&lambda;&alpha;&sigma;.
        We pursued the men, who, flying to precipices, defended
        themselves with stones, and could not be taken. Three
        women, who bit and scratched their leaders, would not
        follow them. Having killed them, we brought their skins to
        Carthage."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>He does not so much as intimate that the creatures who so
    defended themselves with stones, or those whose bodies were
    covered with hair, spoke any language. Nothing but the words
    &alpha;&nu;&theta;&rho;&omega;&pi;&omicron;&iota;
    &alpha;&gamma;&rho;&iota;&omicron;&iota; and
    &gamma;&upsilon;&nu;&alpha;&iota;&kappa;&epsilon;&sigma; can
    lead us to believe that they were human beings at all; while
    the description of the behaviour of the men, and the bodies of
    the women, is not repugnant to the supposition that they were
    large apes, baboons, or orang-outangs, common to this part of
    Africa. At all events, the voyagers do not say that they flayed
    a people having the faculty of speech.</p>

    <p>It is not, however, improbable that the Carthaginians were
    severe taskmasters of the people whom they subdued. Such I
    understand those to have been who opened the British tin mines,
    and who, according to Diodorus Siculus, excessively overworked
    the wretches who toiled for them, "wasting their bodies
    underground, and dying, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page362"
       id="page362"></a>{362}</span> many a one, through extremity
       of suffering, while others perished under the lashes of the
       overseer." (<i>Bibl. Hist.</i> l. v. c. 38.)</p>

    <p class="author">R.T. Hampson.</p>

    <h3>POPE VINDICATED.</h3>

    <p>"P.C.S.S." is too great an admirer of Pope not to seek to
    vindicate him from one, at least, of the blunders attributed to
    him by Mr. D. Stevens, at p. 331. of the "Notes and
    Queries."</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Singed are his <i>brows</i>, the scorching
            <i>lids</i> grow black."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Now, if Mr. S. will refer to Homer, he will find that the
    original fully justifies the use of "brows" and "lids" in the
    <i>plural</i>. It runs thus (<i>Od.</i> ix. v. 389.):</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"&Pi;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&alpha; &delta;&epsilon;
            &upsilon;&iota;
            &beta;&lambda;&epsilon;&phi;&alpha;&rho;
            &alpha;&mu;&phi;&iota; &kappa;&alpha;&iota;
            &omicron;&phi;&rho;&upsilon;&alpha;&sigma;
            &epsilon;&upsilon;&sigma;&epsilon;&nu;
            &alpha;&upsilon;&tau;&mu;&eta;."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>"P.C.S.S." wishes that he could equally remove from Pope the
    charge of inaccuracy respecting the <i>three</i> cannibal meals
    of Polyphemus. He fears that nothing can be alleged to impugn
    Mr. Stevens's perfectly just criticism.</p>

    <p>While on the subject of Pope, "P.C.S.S." would wish to
    advert to a communication (No. 16. p. 246.) in which it is
    insinuated that Pope was probably indebted to Petronius Arbiter
    for the well-known passage&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Worth makes the man, and want of it the fellow;</p>

            <p>The rest is all but leather and prunella."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>With all respect for the ingenious author of that
    communication, "P.C.S.S." confesses that he is unable to
    discover such a similitude of expression as might warrant the
    notion that Pope had been a borrower from Petronius. He cannot
    suppose that Mr. F. could have been led away by any supposed
    analogy between <i>corium</i> and <i>coricillum</i>. The
    latter, Mr. F. must know, is nothing more than a diminutive of
    a diminutive (coricillum, <i>not</i> corcillum, from corculum);
    and the word is coined by Petronius to ridicule one of the
    affectations of Trimalchio (Nero), who was wont to indulge, to
    an absurd extent, in the use of such diminutives (<i>vide</i>
    Burmann, <i>in loco</i>). "P.C.S.S." will now subjoin such
    translations of the passage in question as he has hitherto had
    opportunities of referring to. The first is from <i>The Works
    of Petronius Arbiter, translated by several hands</i>, Lond.
    8vo. 4th edit. 1714. At the beginning of the translation itself
    there is this heading&mdash;"Made English by Mr. Wilson, of the
    Middle Temple, and several others." The passage in question is
    thus rendered:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Come, my friends, let us see how merry you can be! for
        in my time, I have been no better than yourselves; but, by
        my own industry, I am what I am. <i>'Tis the heart makes
        the man</i>; all the rest is but stuff!"</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>In another translation, which, with Grub-Street audacity,
    the publisher, in his title-passage, presumes to attribute to
    Addison! and which appeared in 1736 (Lond. 8vo.), the passage
    is as follows:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"I was once as you are: but now, thanks to my industry,
        I am what I am. <i>It is the heart that makes the man</i>;
        all the rest is but stuff!"</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Be the translator who he may, this version, so impudently
    ascribed to the moral Addison, is written with much spirit and
    power, and with a remarkable comprehension of the author's
    meaning. Some of the poetical fragments at the end are, indeed,
    singularly well done.</p>

    <p>Of the two French versions which "P.C.S.S." has examined,
    the one by Levaur (Paris, 8vo. 1726) thus translates the
    passage:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Je vous prie, mes amis ... <i>C'est le coeur qui fait
        les hommes; je compte le reste pour un

    <h3>"THE SUPPER OF THE LORDE."</h3>

    <p>I shall be glad to find that your correspondent "C.H." (No.
    21. p. 333.) receives a satisfactory answer to his inquiry, as
    such a reply would also satisfy my earlier query, No. 7. p.
    109. I perceive, however, from his letter, that I can give him
    some information on other points noticed in it, though the
    absence of papers now passing through the press with the Parker
    Society's reprint of a third volume of Tyndale, will prevent my
    replying with such precision as I could wish. That ancient
    tract on "The Supper of the Lorde, after the true meanyng of
    the sixte of John," &amp;c., of which "C.H." says he possesses
    a copy, was reprinted at different intervals with the same
    date, viz., MCCCCCXXXIII, Apryll v., on its title-page. The
    original edition has a final colophon, stating that it was
    "imprinted at Nornberg, by Nielas Twonson," and is so rare,
    that I have not been able to discover the existence of any
    copy, but one recently deposited in the Bodleian. That "C.H.'s"
    copy is not a specimen of that first edition, is apparent from
    two circumstances. The first is, that he has given you a
    quotation from his copy as follows:&mdash;"And as for M. More,
    whom the verity most offendeth, and doth but mocke it," whereas
    the original edition has, "And as for M. Mocke," &amp;c., and
    Sir Thomas More notices this mockage of his name in his reply.
    The next is, that his copy contains "Crowley's Epistle to the
    Reader," which does not appear in any edition of an earlier
    date than 1551. When first attached to this treatise, the
    epistle was anonymous, as may be seen in the Lambeth copy; but
    Crowley eventually <span class="pagenum"><a name="page363"
       id="page363"></a>{363}</span> affixed his name to the
       epistle, as it appears in "C.H.'s" and in other copies.
       Robert Crowley was a fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford;
       vicar of St. Giles, Cripplegate; a printer and publisher;
       but to his singular combination of titles, we cannot add
       that of author of the treatise in question. "C.H." has seen
       that he did not enter Oxford till 1534; and in his Prefatory
       Epistle, Crowley speaks of the author of the treatise as a
       person distinct from himself.</p>

    <p>I do not wish, however, to be considered as positively
    affirming the treatise to be Tyndale's. Foxe, the
    martyrologist, edited Tyndale's works for Day, and he has only
    said that this treatise was "compiled, as some do gather, by M.
    Wm. Tyndale, because the method and phrase agree with his, and
    the time of writing are [sic] concurrent." On the other hand,
    the authorship is unhesitatingly assigned to Tyndale by Mr. C.
    Anderson (<i>Annals of the English Bible</i>, &sect;ix. <i>ad
    finem</i>), and by Mr. Geo. Offer (<i>Mem. of Tyndale</i>, p.
    30.), the two most pains-taking and best informants as to his
    works. But still there are objections of such force, that I
    must confess myself rather inclined to attribute the treatise
    to Joy's pen, if I could but be satisfied that he was capable
    of writing so correctly, and of keeping so clear of vulgarity
    in a controversy with a popish persecutor.</p>

    <p><i>Curious Symbolical Custom</i>.&mdash;On Saturday last I
    married a couple in the parish church. An old woman, an aunt of
    the bridegroom, displeased at the marriage, stood at the church
    gate and pronounced an anathema on the married pair. She then
    bought a new broom, went home, swept her house, and hung the
    broom over the door. By this she intimated her rejection of her
    nephew, and forbade him to enter her house. Is this a known
    custom? What is its origin?</p>

    <p><i>The Wild Huntsman</i>.&mdash;The interesting
    contributions of your correspondent "Seleucus," on "Folk Lore,"
    brought to my recollection the "Wild Huntsman" of the German
    poet, Tieck; of whose verses on that superstitious belief,
    still current among the imaginative peasantry of Germany, I
    send you a translation, <i>done into English</i> many years
    ago. The Welsh dogs of Annwn, or "couriers of the
    air"&mdash;the spirit-hounds who hunt the souls of the
    dead&mdash;are part of that popular belief existing among all
    nations, which delivers up the noon of night to ungracious

    <h3>ON AUTHORS AND BOOKS, NO. VI.</h3>

    <p>In the union of scholarship, polished manners, and
    amiability of character, we have had few men to surpass the
    reverend Joseph Spence. His career was suitable to his deserts.
    He was fortunate in his connections, fortunate in his
    appointments, and fortunate in his share of fame.</p>

    <p>His fame, however, is somewhat diminished. His <i>Essay on
    the Odyssey</i>, which procured him the friendship of Pope, has
    ceased to be in request; his <i>Polymetis</i>, once the
    ornament of every choice library, has been superseded by the
    publications of Millin and Smith; his poems are only to be met
    with in the collections of Dodsley and Nichols. If we now dwell
    with pleasure on his name, it is chiefly as a recorder of the
    sayings of others&mdash;it is on account of his assiduity in
    making <i>notes!</i> I allude to the volume entitled
    <i>Anecdotes, observations, and characters of books and
    men</i>, which was edited by my friend Mr. Singer, with his
    wonted care and ability in 1820.</p>

    <p>The <i>Essay on the Odyssey</i> was first published
    anonymously in 1726-7. It was reprinted in 1737 and 1747. A
    copy of the latter edition, now in my possession, contains this
    curious note:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"It is remarkable that of twelve passages objected to in
        this critique on the English Odyssey, <i>two</i> only are
        found in those books which were translated by Pope.</p>

        <p>"From Mr. Langton, who had his information from Mr.
        Spence.</p>

        <p>"When Spence carried his preface to Gorboduc in
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="page364"
           id="page364"></a>{364}</span> 1736 to Pope, he asked him
           his opinion. Pope said 'It would do very well; there was
           nothing <i>pert</i> or <i>low</i> in it.' Spence was
           satisfied with this praise, which however, was in
           implied censure on all his other writings.&mdash;He is
           very fond of the familiar vulgarisms of common talk, and
           is the very reverse of Dr. Johnson.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>"E.M." [Edmond Malone.]</p>

    <p>The note is not signed at length, but there can be no doubt
    as to its authorship, as I purchased the volume which contains
    it at the sale of the unreserved books of Mr. Malone in
    1818.</p>

    <h2>QUERIES.</h2>

    <h3>NICHOLAS BRETON'S "CROSSING OF PROVERBS."</h3>

    <p>Although my query respecting William Basse and his poem,
    "Great Britain's Sun's Set," (No. 13. p. 200), produced no
    positive information touching that production, it gave an
    opportunity to some of your correspondents to communicate
    valuable intelligence relating to the author and to other works
    by him, for which I, for one, was very much obliged. If I did
    not obtain exactly what I wanted, I obtained something that
    hereafter may be extremely useful; and that I could not,
    perhaps, have obtained in any other way than through the medium
    of your pleasant and welcome periodical.</p>

    <p>I am now, therefore, about to put a question regarding
    another writer of more celebrity and ability. Among our early
    pamphleteers, there was certainly none more voluminous than
    Nicholas Breton, who began writing in 1575, and did not lay
    down his pen until late in the reign of James I. A list of his
    pieces (by no means complete, but the fullest that has been
    compiled) may be seen in Lowndes's <i>Bibl. Manual</i>; it
    includes several not by Breton, among them Sir Philip Sidney's
    <i>Ourania</i>, 1606, which in fact is by a person of the name
    Backster; and it omits the one to which my present
    communication refers, and regarding which I am at some
    loss.</p>

    <p>In the late Mr. Heber's <i>Catalogue</i>, part iv. p. 10., I
    read as follows, under the name of Nicholas Breton:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Crossing of Proverbs. The Second Part, with certaine
        briefe Questions and Answeres, by N.B., Gent. Extremely
        rare and very curious, <i>but imperfect</i>. It appears to
        contain a portion of the first part, and also of the
        second; but it appears to be unknown."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Into whose hands this fragment devolved I know not; and that
    is one point I am anxious to ascertain, because I have another
    fragment, which consists of what is evidently the first sheet
    of the first part of the tract in question, with the following
    title-page, which I quote <i>totidem literis</i>:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Crossing of Proverbs. Crosse-Answeres. And
        Crosse-Humours. By B.N., Gent. At London, Printed for John
        Wright, and are to be solde at his Shop without Newgate, at
        the signe of the Bible, 1616."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>It is in 8vo., as Heber's fragment appears to have been; but
    then the initials of the author are given as N.B., whereas in
    my fragment they stand B.N., a usual inversion with Nicholas
    Breton; the brief address "To the Reader" is also subscribed
    B.N.; and then begins the body of the work, thus headed:
    "Crosse and Pile, or, Crossing of Proverbs." It opens as
    follows:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"<i>Proverb</i>. The more the merrier.</p>

            <p><i>Cross</i>. Not so; one hand is enough in a
            purse.</p>

            <p><i>P.</i> Every man loves himselfe best.</p>

            <p><i>C.</i> Not so, when man is undone by
            suretyship.</p>

            <p><i>P.</i> He that runnes fastest gets most
            ground.</p>

            <p><i>C.</i> Not so, for then foote-men would have more
            land than their masters.</p>

            <p><i>P.</i> He runnes far that never turnes.</p>

            <p><i>C.</i> Not so, he may breake his necke in a short
            course.</p>

            <p><i>P.</i> No man can call againe yesterday.</p>

            <p><i>C.</i> Yes, hee may call till his heart ake,
            though it never come.</p>

            <p><i>P.</i> Had I wist was a foole.</p>

            <p><i>C.</i> No, he was a foole that said so."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>And so it proceeds, not without humour and point, here and
    there borrowing from known sources, as in the
    following:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"<i>Proverb.</i> The world is a long journey.</p>

            <p><i>Cros.</i> Not so, the sunne goes it every
            day.</p>

            <p><i>P.</i> It is a great way to the bottom of the
            sea.</p>

            <p><i>C.</i> Not so, it is but a stone's cast."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>However, my object is not to give specimens of the
    production further than are necessary for its identification.
    My queries are, 1st, Who bought Mr. Heber's fragment, and where
    is it now to be found? 2nd, Are any of your correspondents
    aware of the existence of a perfect copy of the work?</p>

    <p>I naturally take a peculiar interest about Nicholas Breton,
    because I have in my possession an unknown collection of
    amatory and pastoral poems by him, printed in quarto in 1604,
    in matter and measure obvious imitations of productions in "The
    Passionate Pilgrim," 1599, imputed to Shakespeare, and some of
    which are unquestionably by Richard Barnfield.</p>

    <p>Any new information regarding Breton and his works will be
    most acceptable to me. I am already in possession of undoubted
    proof that he was the Nicholas Breton whose epitaph is on the
    chancel-wall of the church of Norton, in Northamptonshire, a
    point Ritson seems to have questioned.</p>

    <h3>THE SWORD CALLED CURTANA.</h3>

    <p>In the wardrobe account for the year 1483, are "iij swerdes,
    whereof oon with a flat poynte,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page365"
       id="page365"></a>{365}</span> called <i>curtana</i>, and ij
       other swords, all iij swords covered in a yerde di of
       crymysym tisshue cloth of gold."</p>

    <p>The name of <i>curtana</i> for many ages continued to be
    given to the first royal sword in England. It existed as long
    ago as the reign of Henry III., at whose coronation (A.D. 1236)
    it was carried by the Earl of Chester. We find it at the
    coronations of Edward II. and Richard II.; also in the time of
    Henry IV., Richard III., and Henry VII.; and among the royal
    arms of Edward VI. we read of "a swerde called
    <i>curtana</i>."</p>

    <p>Can any of your readers explain the origin of the name
    <i>curtana</i>, a sword so famous that it carries us back to
    the days of ancient chivalry, when it was wielded by the Dane
    <i>Uggiero</i>, or by the still more famed <i>Orlando</i>.</p>

    <h3>IS THE DOMBEC THE DOMESDAY OF ALFRED?</h3>

    <p>I beg to propose the following "Query":&mdash;Is the
    <i>Dombec</i>, a work referred to in the Laws of Edward the
    Elder, the same as what has been called the Domesday or
    Winchester Book of Alfred the Great? I incline to think that it
    is not, and shall be much obliged to any of your
    correspondents, learned in the Anglo-Saxon period of our
    history, who will give himself the trouble of resolving my
    doubts.</p>

    <p>Sir Henry Spelman, in his Glossary <i>voce Dombec</i>, calls
    it the <i>Liber Judicialis</i> of the Anglo-Saxons; and says it
    is mentioned in the first chapter of the laws of Edward the
    Elder, where the king directs his judges to conduct themselves
    in their judicial proceedings as on [Old English: thaere dom
    bec stand], that is, as <i>is enjoined in their Dome
    Book</i>.&mdash;"Quod," he continues, "an de pr&aelig;cedentium
    Regum legibus qu&aelig; hodie extant, intelligendum sit: an de
    alio quopiam libro hactenus non prodeunte, incertum est."</p>

    <p>But this uncertainty does not seem to have attached itself
    to the mind of Sir William Blackstone; for in the third section
    of the Introduction prefixed to his <i>Commentaries on the Laws
    of England</i>, he informs us that our antiquaries "tell us
    that in the time of Alfred, the local customs of the several
    provinces of the kingdom were grown so various, that he found
    it expedient to compile his <i>Dome Book</i>, or <i>Liber
    Judicialis</i>, for the general use of the whole kingdom." This
    book is said to have been extant so late as the reign of King
    Edward IV., but is now unfortunately lost. It contained, we may
    probably suppose, the principal maxims of the common law, the
    penalties for misdemeanors, and the forms of judicial
    proceedings. Thus much may be at least collected from that
    injunction to observe it, which we find in the Laws of King
    Edward the Elder, the son of Alfred.&mdash;"<i>Omnibus qui
    reipublic&aelig; pr&aelig;sunt etiam atque etiam mando, ut
    omnibus &aelig;quos se pr&aelig;beant judices, perinde ac in
    judiciali libro</i> (Saxonice, [Old English: dom bec])
    <i>scriptum habetur: nec quidquid formident quin jus
    commune</i> (Saxonice, [Old English: folcrihte]) <i>audactes
    libereque dicant.</i>"</p>

    <p>But notwithstanding this, it appears to me by no means
    conclusive, that the <i>Dombec</i> referred to in the Laws of
    Edward the Elder and the <i>Liber Judicialis</i> of Alfred are
    the same; on the contrary, Alfred's <i>Liber Judicialis</i>
    seems to have been known not under the name of <i>Dombec</i>,
    but under that of the <i>Winchester Roll</i>, from the
    circumstance of its having been principally kept at Winchester:
    and Sir Henry Spelman says, the Domesday Book of William the
    Conqueror was sometimes called <i>Rotulus Wintoni&aelig;, a
    similitudine antiquoris</i>, from its resemblance to an older
    document preserved at Winchester. And he quotes Ingulphus Abbot
    of Croyland, who says, "Iste rotulus (<i>i.e.</i> the Domesday
    Book of William) vocatus est Rotulus Wintoni&aelig;, et ab
    Anglicis pro sua generalitate, omnia tenementa totius
    terr&aelig; integre continente <i>Domesday</i> cognominatur."
    And the he proceeds, "Talem rotulum et multum similem; ediderat
    quondam Rex Alfredus, in quo totam terram Angli&aelig; per
    comitatus, centurias, et decurias descripserat, sicut
    pr&aelig;notatur. Qui quidem Rotulus Wintoni&aelig; vocatus
    est, quia deponebatur apud Wintoniam conservandus," &amp;c.</p>

    <p>Here is nothing said of this work being called [Old English:
    dom bec]: neither does Spelman, in his enumeration of the works
    of Alfred, give the least intimation that any one of his
    collections of laws was called [Old English: dom bec].</p>

    <p>We know, indeed, that Alfred compiled a code of laws for his
    subjects; but whether any part of them has been preserved, or
    how much of them is embodied in subsequent codes, cannot now be
    determined. Asser mentions that he frequently reprimanded the
    judges for wrong judgments; and Spelman, that he wrote "a book
    against unjust magistrates," but any complete body of laws, if
    such was ever framed by Alfred, is now lost; and that
    attributed to him in Wilkin's <i>Leges Anglo-Saxon</i>, is held
    in suspicion by most writers.</p>

    <p>For these reasons, and considering that Sir William
    Blackstone's knowledge of English history was rather
    superficial, I incline to the belief, that the [Old English:
    dom bec] referred to in the laws of Edward the Elder, was some
    collection of laws made <i>prior</i> to the time of Alfred:
    this might clearly be the case, as Sharon Turner informs us
    that the Saxon laws were committed to writing as early as the
    commencement of the 7th century.</p>

    <p>The opinions of your learned correspondents on this disputed
    point may be of much interest to many of your readers, and to
    none more than to</p>

    <h3>MINOR QUERIES.</h3>

    <p><i>MSS. of the Wycliffite Translations of the
    Scriptures</i>.&mdash;The Add. MS. 15,521., in the British
    Museum, contains a copy of Lewis's edition of the <i>Wycliffite
    New Testament</i>, printed in 1731, with manuscript notes by
    Ames and Lewis, and the former has transcribed into it some
    <i>additional prologues</i>, prefixed to each book of the New
    Testament, which had not been printed by Lewis, and were taken
    by Ames from a MS. of the New Testament, written in 1424, and
    in 1731 in the possession of Thomas Granger. It would be very
    desirable to learn what became of this MS. subsequently.
    Granger died in the following year, but the MS. does not appear
    in the sale catalogue of his library, nor is it found in the
    catalogue of Ames's own library, dispersed in 1760. Any
    information relative to this remarkable copy of the New
    Testament, would be very acceptable to the Editors of the
    <i>Wycliffite Versions of the Scriptures</i>, who are now,
    after a literary labour of more than twenty years, about to
    bring the work to a conclusion. They would also feel much
    obliged by the communication of any notices of MSS. of the
    Wycliffite versions, <i>existing in private hands</i>,
    exclusive of those copies of which they already possess
    descriptions, existing in the libraries of the following
    individuals:&mdash;Mrs. Allanson of Farn, Flintshire, the Earl
    of Ashburnham, Sir Thomas Phillipps, Bart., Sir Peregrine

    of your readers inform me what is the origin of the custom
    observed at Court, of persons in the royal presence not wearing

    and 1836), in which a passage in Massinger, which alludes to
    lawyers going to St. Albans, is illustrated by an inscription
    in the nave of St. Alban's Abbey Church, which records that the

    <p><i>Richard Haley, or Hales.&mdash;Milton
    Pedigree</i>.&mdash;I should feel obliged by any particulars
    respecting Richard Haley, or Hales, of Idlestreete, otherwise
    Ilstreyd, in com. Hertford, yeoman; my object being to
    ascertain the nature of some transaction he had with Milton, in
    July 1674, referred to in a bond which the former executed,
    dated the 27th of that month, for performance of the covenants
    contained in an indenture of even date.</p>

    <p>Is any thing known of Richard Milton, who signs his name as
    the attesting witness to the releases given by two of the
    poet's daughters for their share of his estate? Is there any
    pedigree of the family of Sir Christopher Milton, the poet's
    brother, drawn up with sufficient apparent accuracy to exclude
    the probability of Richard Milton being his son? I have
    referred to the pedigree in the British Museum (Harl. MS. 5802.
    fo. 19b.), which makes no mention of the letter; but it is
    evidently so imperfect a notice, as to be of little authority
    one way or other.</p>

    <p><i>Sapcote Motto</i>.&mdash;Over the old gatehouse of Elton,
    co. Hunts., built by the family of Sapcote, is their coat of
    arms, namely, "three dove-cotes;" and upon a scroll,
    surrounding the lower part of the shield, is carved a motto,
    evidently French, and as evidently cut by a person ignorant of
    that language. So far as I can decypher it, the letters appear
    to be</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">

    <p>Possibly the first and last letters <i>s</i> are only
    flourishes. I shall be glad of any suggestion as to its
    meaning.</p>

    <p>I have not been able to find the Sapcote motto on record;
    and I believe the Carysfoot family, the possessors of Elton,
    and the Duke of Bedford, the heir in blood, to be ignorant of
    what this scroll is intended to represent.</p>

    (Janet et Cotelle, 1823), in the preface is the following
    passage.&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Vert-vert fut bient&ocirc;t dans toutes les mains. Le
        suffrage de la multitude se joignit &agrave; celui des

    <p>The <i>Query</i> I wish to make is, Have any of these

    painted on enamel china, or earthenware of any sort, of French
    or any other manufacture, come to light of late years? or more

    various buyers of almost all nations, in the sales within these
    few weeks effected at Paris?</p>

    <p><i>Urbanus Regius</i>.&mdash;A friend of mine, a delightful
    old lady, fresh, genial, and inquisitive, has in her possession
    an old volume, a family heir-loom, which is not the less dear
    to her for being somewhat dingy and dilapidated, and touching
    which she would gladly receive such information as your
    correspondents can supply.</p>

    <p>It is made up of three apparently distinct treatises; the
    first (of which several leaves are wanting) on the twelve
    articles of the Apostles' Creed. The second is "The ryght
    foundation, and pryncypall common places of the hole godly
    Scripture," &amp;c., by Doctor Urbanus Regius. Prefixed is an
    epistle to Thomas, Archbishop of Canterbury (evidently
    Cranmer), to whom "Hys dayly oratoure, Gwalter Lynne (the
    writer of the epistle), wyssheth lyfe euerlastynge." Between
    this second treatise and the third, and apparently belonging to
    the latter, is a title-page with the following inscription:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Imprinted for Gwalter Lynne, dwelling upon Somers Kaye,
        by Byllinges gate. In the yeare of oure Lorde. MDXLVIII.
        And they by [<i>sic</i>] to be solde at Poules church yarde
        at the north doore, In the signe of the By-bell, By Richard
        Jugge."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This last treatise is in smaller type than the others, and
    has no general designation: it contains chapters on various
    subjects, <i>e.g.</i> "The Signification of Baptism,"
    &amp;c.</p>

    <p>Query 1. Is this volume well known? 2. Who were Urbanus
    Regius and Walter Lynne?</p>

    <p>18. Colebrooke's <i>Algebra of the Hindus</i>.</p>

    <p>Would it not be worth while to give a <i>facsimile</i> of
    the "Tabel for all manere of merchauntes," in the "Notes and
    Queries"? It is not only a curiosity, but an important element
    (and unique as far as is known) in the philosophic history of
    our arithmetic. It was, no doubt, an actual instrument in
    constant use in the merchant's office, as much so as an
    almanac, interest-tables, a "cambist" and a copying-press, are
    now.</p>

    <p>As regards the cipher, the difficulty only commenced with
    <i>writing numbers</i> in the new symbology. With persons
    accustomed to the use of this instrument, there is no doubt
    that the mode of obviating the difficulty of "keeping the
    place," would suggest itself at once. In this instrument an
    empty hole (without its peg) <i>signified</i> "none of this
    denomination." What then more simple than to make the outline
    of the empty hole which occupied the "local position" of any
    denomination, when none of that precise denomination occurred
    in the number itself? Under this view the process at least
    becomes simple and natural; and as the early merchants
    contributed so largely to the improvement of our arithmetical
    processes, such a conclusion is wholly divested of
    improbability on any other ground. The circle would then
    naturally become, as it certainly has practically become, the
    most appropriate symbol of <i>nothingness</i>.</p>

    <p>As regards the term <i>cipher</i> or <i>zero</i> (which are
    so obviously the same as to need no remark), it is admitted on
    all hands to be derived from one or other of the Semitic
    languages, the Hebrew or the Arabic. It is customery with the
    mathematical historians to refer it to the Arabic, they being
    in general more conversant with it than with the Hebrew. The
    Arabic being a smaller hand than the Hebrew, a dot was used
    instead of the circle for marking the "place" at which the
    hiatus of any "denomination" occurred. If we obtained our
    cipher from this, it would be made hollow (a mere
    <i>ceinture</i>, girdle, or ring) to save the trouble of making
    a dot sufficiently large to correspond in magnitude with our
    other numerals as we write them. Either is alike
    possible&mdash;probability must be sought, for either over the
    other, from a slightly different source.</p>

    <p>The root-words in Hebrew and in Arabic are precisely the
    same (<i>ts-ph-r</i>), though in the two
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page368"
       id="page368"></a>{368}</span> languages, and at different
       ages of the same language, they might have been vowelised
       differently. In some shape or other, this name is used in
       all countries that have derived their arithmetic from
       medi&aelig;val Italy, or from the Saracens. It is with some
       <i>cipher</i>, with others <i>chiffre</i>, and with all
       <i>zero</i>. The word is certainly no more Italian than it
       is French or English. Be it remembered, too, that
       <i>ezor</i> (quoted at p. 268.), as a <i>girdle</i>, is
       radically the same word, somewhat mutilated. The cardinal
       meaning of the word (denuded of the conventional accretions
       of signification, which peculiar applications of it adds to
       the cardinal meaning) appears to be <i>emptiness</i>,
       <i>hollowness</i>, <i>nothingness</i>. It may be further
       remarked, that in the fine Chartres MS. of Boetius,
       described by Chasles, the 0 is called
       <i>sipos</i>:&mdash;the same name, he remarks, that Graves
       found in use in the East. The modern Turks call the 0,
       <i>tsifra</i>.</p>

    <p>It is curious enough that in all languages, the term
    <i>ciphering</i> is popularly used to denote all arithmetical
    operations whatever. Our schoolboys do their "ciphering," and
    write carefully in their "ciphering-books." This all seems to
    point to the art of dispensing with the use of the abacus or
    counting table.</p>

    <p><i>Arabic Numerals</i>.&mdash;I had replied to "E.V." (No.
    15. p. 230.), when I saw by your "Notice to Correspondents,"
    that the question was answered. I therefore waited the
    publication of the replies, which I find do not embrace any one
    of the points to which I would call the attention of
    "E.V."&mdash;Diophantus of Alexandria, who flourished about 150
    years after Christ, and who wrote thirteen books of algebra or
    arithmetic in the Greek language, is generally supposed to be
    the oldest writer on the subject that has come down to our
    time; but it was not from him that we received the knowledge of
    algebra in Europe. It appears certain that the first knowledge
    of this science in England was from Italy or Spain, after the
    Moors settled in the latter country; and the Arabians and
    Persians appear to have derived their arithmetical method of
    computing by ten characters from the Indians: who, in their
    turn, have most probably borrowed from the Chinese, and
    improved on their method by the adoption of a zero, which was
    one of the most important improvements effected by the Hindoos.
    In China, the words ancient and modern are almost synonymous;
    their usages and customs being so unchangeable, as appears by
    their instrument of computation, the <i>swanpan</i>, which is
    still used in all their calculations. The Oriental scholar will
    find much curious and interesting information connected with
    this subject in the Sanscrit <i>Vija Ganita</i> and
    <i>Lilivati</i> of Bhaskara Acharya: the former was translated
    into Persian at Agra, or Delhi, in 1634, and the latter by
    Fyzee in 1587; but there are also English translations, all of
    which are in the library of the Royal Asiatic Society. The
    <i>Khalasah-ul-Hisah</i> is another work of repute in India.
    Mr. Strachey wrote and printed in India, for the <i>Asiatic
    Researches</i>, a valuable paper, which contains most
    conclusive evidence of the Indian (if not Chinese) origin of
    our numerals. See also <i>Astronomie Indienne</i>, of M.
    Bailly; 2d vol. <i>Asiatic Researches</i>, "On the Astronomical
    Computations of the Hindoos," by Saml. Davis; "Two
    Dissertations on Indian Astronomy and Trigonometry," by
    Professor Playfair, in the 2d and 4th vols. of the <i>Edinburgh
    Philosophical Transactions</i>. And many others might be
    referred to; but all tending to prove that our numbers came
    originally from China and India, through Persia, Arabia,
    Africa, Spain, and Italy, by gradual and successive changes in
    form, several of them still retaining a close resemblance to
    the ancient and modern Sanscrit, Chinese, Arabic, Persian, and
    Hindoo numerals.</p>

    <h3>REPLIES TO MINOR QUERIES.</h3>

    <p>I send you a few Notes on Queries scattered through some of
    the later numbers of your very valuable publication:</p>

    <p><i>Anonymous Ravennas</i>.&mdash;In the library of the Royal
    Geographical Society, I believe there is a copy of an 8vo.
    edition of that cosmography.</p>

    <p><i>Selago</i>.&mdash;This plant, I should think it probable,
    is the <i>Lycopodium clavatum</i> of modern botanists; the
    seeds of which, when ripe, and when the plant is struck, rise
    like smoke ("fumum" of Pliny), and may have been supposed, from
    their remarkable inflammability when dashed into a flame,
    igniting with a sudden flash, to have possessed wonderful
    virtues. The species known as <i>Lycopodium selago</i> is rare
    in comparison to the other.</p>

    <p><i>Portugal</i>.&mdash;In the library of the Geographical
    Society are some of the more recent works published in Lisbon
    on the topography of that country, but they are generally very
    meagre and unsatisfactory. In a periodical published in Lisbon
    in numbers, on the plan of the <i>Penny Magazine</i>, there is
    a good deal of information, with engravings, regarding many
    places of interest in Portugal. I think it is called <i>The
    Album</i>, but I am sorry I have not at present the power of
    sending you more correct particulars concerning it. It is in
    4to.</p>

    <p>Portugal is a country that is so little travelled in either
    by natives or foreigners, that information regarding places in
    the interior is not easily obtained; and facilities for
    travelling, as well as accommodation for travellers, is of a
    very limited description.</p>

    <p><i>Sir Roger de Coverley</i>.&mdash;In one of your early
    numbers was a query on this subject, which I do not think has
    been yet answered. I have a MS.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page369"
       id="page369"></a>{369}</span> account of the family of
       Calverley, of Calverley, in Yorkshire, an autograph of Ralph
       Thoresby in the year 1717, in which occurs the following
       passage:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"<i>Roger</i>, so named from the Archbishop" (of York),
        "was a person of renowned hospitality, since, at this day,
        the obsolete known tune of <i>Roger a Calverley</i> is
        referred to him, who, according to the custom of those
        times, kept his <i>minstrells</i>, from that their office
        named <i>harpers</i>, which became a family and possessed
        lands till late years in and about <i>Calverley</i>, called
        to this day <i>Harpersroids</i> and <i>Harper's
        Spring</i>.... He was a knight, and lived in the time of K.
        Richard 1st. His seal, appended to one of his charters, is
        large, with a chevalier on horseback."</p>

    <h3>DERIVATIONS OF "NEWS."</h3>

    <p>It is not declared with what motive "Mr. GUTCH" (No. 17. p.
    270.) has laid before the readers of "NOTES AND QUERIES" the
    alleged derivation of N.E.W.S.</p>

    <p>It must therefore be supposed, that his object was to have
    its justness and probability commented upon; and it is quite
    time that they should be so, since the derivation in question
    has of late become quite a favourite authoritative dictum with
    etymology compilers. Thus it may be found, in the very words
    and form adopted by your correspondent, in Haydn's
    <i>Dictionary of Dates</i>, and in other authorities of equal
    weight.</p>

    <p>This sort of initial-letter derivation was probably brought
    into fashion in England by the alleged origin of "Cabal," or,
    perhaps, by the many guesses at the much disputed word
    "&AElig;ra." I shall take the liberty of quoting a few
    sentences with reference to such etymologies, <i>as a
    class</i>, which I find in an unpublished manuscript upon a
    kindred subject.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Besides, such a splitting up of a word of significant
        and perfect meaning in itself is always a bad and
        suspicious mode of derivation.</p>

        <p>"It is generally an after-thought, suggested by some
        fortuitous or fancied coincidence, that appropriateness of
        which is by no means a sufficient proof of probability.</p>

        <p>"Of this there can scarcely be a better example than the
        English word 'news,' which, notwithstanding the felicity of
        its supposed derivation from the four cardinal points,
        must, nevertheless, so long as the corresponding words
        'nova,' 'nouvelles,' &amp;c. exist, be consigned to its
        more sober and common-place origin in the adjective
        '<i>new</i>.'"</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>To this it must be added that the ancient orthography of the
    word <i>newes</i>, completely upsets the derivation Mr. Gutch
    has brought before your readers. Hone quotes from "one Burton,
    printed in 1614: 'if any one read now-a-days, it is a
    play-book, or <i>a pamphlet</i> of <i>newes</i>."</p>

    <p>I had been in two minds whether or not to send this
    communication, when the scale is completely turned by the
    apropos occurrence of a corroboration of this latter objection
    in "NOTES AND QUERIES" of this day. Mr. Rimbault mentions (at
    p. 277.), "a rare black letter volume entitled <i>Newes from
    Scotland</i>, 1591."</p>

    <p>Here is one more proof of the usefulness of your
    publication, that I am thus enabled to strengthen the
    illustration of a totally different subject by the incidental
    authority of a fellow correspondent.</p>

    <p><i>Swot</i> is, as the querist supposes, a military cant
    term, and a sufficiently vulgar one too. It originated at the
    great slang-manufactory for the army, the Royal Military
    College, Sandhurst. You may depend upon the following account
    of it, which I had many years ago from the late Thomas
    Leybourne, F.R.S., Senior Professor of Mathematics in that
    college.</p>

    <p>One of the Professors, Dr. William Wallace, in addition to
    his being a Scotchman, had a bald head, and an exceedingly
    "broad Scotch" accent, besides a not very delicate
    discrimination in the choice of his English terms relating to
    social life. It happened on one hot summer's day, nearly half a
    century ago, that he had been teaching a class, and had worked
    himself into a considerable effusion from the skin. He took out
    his handkerchief, rubbed his head and forehead violently, and
    exclaimed in his Perthshire dialect,&mdash;"<i>It maks one
    swot</i>." This was a God-send to the "gentlemen cadets,"
    wishing to achieve a notoriety as wits and slangsters; and
    mathematics generally ever after became <i>swot</i>, and
    mathematicians <i>swots</i>. I have often heard it
    said:&mdash;"I never could do <i>swot</i> well, Sir;" and
    "these dull fellows, the <i>swots</i>, can talk of nothing but
    triangles and equations."</p>

    <p>I should have thought that the <i>sheer disgustingness</i>
    of the idea would have shut the word out of the vocabularies of
    English <i>gentlemen</i>. It remains nevertheless a standard
    term in the vocabulary of an English soldier. It is well, at
    all events, that future ages should know its etymology.</p>

    282. 323, 324.)&mdash;I am sorry to see that no progress has
    yet been made towards a satisfactory explanation of this
    office. I was in hopes that something better than mere
    conjecture would have been supplied from the peculiar
    facilities of "T.R.F." "W.H.C." (p. 323.) has done little more
    than refer to the same instruments as had been already adverted
    to by me in p. 269., with the new reading
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page370"
       id="page370"></a>{370}</span> of <i>poulterer</i> for poker!
       With repect to "T.R.F.'s" conjecture, I should be more ready
       to accept it if he could produce a single example of the
       word <i>pawker</i>, in the sense of a hog-warden. The
       quotation from the Pipe-roll of John is founded on a
       mistake. The entry occurs in other previous rolls, and is
       there clearly explained to refer to the <i>porter of
       Hereford Castle</i>. Thus, in Pipe 2 Hen. II. and 3 Hen. II.
       we have, under Hereford,</p>

            <p>"In liberatione portarii castelli ... 30<i>s.</i>

    <p>In Pipe 1 Ric. I. we have,</p>

    <p>A similar entry is to be found in other rolls, as well
    printed as inedited. I could indulge some other criticisms on
    the communication of your correspondent in Spring Gardens, but
    I prefer encouraging him to make further inquiries, and to
    produce from the records in his custody some more satisfactory
    solution of the difficulty. In the meantime, let me refer to a
    Survey of Wrigmore Castle in the Lansdowne Collection, No. 40.
    fo. 82. The surveyor there reports, that the paling, rails,
    &amp;c. of the park are much decayed in many and sundry places,
    and he estimates the repairs, with allowance of timber from the
    wood there, "by good surveye and oversight of the <i>poker</i>
    and other officers of the said parke," at 4<i>l.</i> The date
    of the survey is 13 May, 1584.</p>

    <p>Comparing this notice of the office with the receiver's
    accounts tempore Hen. VII. and Hen. VIII. (<i>ant&egrave;</i>,
    p. 269.), in which the officer is called "pocarius omnium
    boscorum," I cannot doubt that his duty, or at least one of his
    duties, was that of woodward, and that, as such, he assigned
    timber for repair of the premises. How he came by his local
    title and style of poker is a mystery on which we have all
    hitherto failed to throw any light.</p>

    an engraving of what, from his account, I doubt not he will

    p. 15., "RAHERE" will find an account and references to
    numerous examples of palimpsest brasses, to which class the one

    been removed from the Rectory and placed in the tomb of Abbot

    Rochester (where the cause of the second engraving is found to

    Cambridgeshire. Of this last, an engraving and description, by
    Mr. A.W. Franks, is given in the fourteenth part of the
    Publications of the Cambridge Antiquarian Society."</p>

    <p class="note">One from "WILLIAM SPARROW SIMPSON," who

    <p class="note">"It is also described in the Oxford
    Architectural Society's <i>Manual of Mon. Brasses</i>, No. 6.
    pp. 6, 7. other examples of which occur at Rochester, Kent, and
    at Cobham, Surrey. A small plate of brass, in the possession of
    a friend, has on one side a group of children, and on the
    reverse the uplifted hands of an earlier figure."</p>

    <p class="note">And lastly, one from "A.P.H." (to which we
    cannot do ample justice, as we do not keep an engraver), from
    which we extract the following passages:&mdash;</p>

    <p class="note">"A friend of mine has a shield in his
    possession, taken from a slab, and which has been enamelled. It
    is of late date and rudely executed. On the back is
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page371"

       small female figure, very nearly a century earlier in date.
       I can also remember an inscription in Cuxton Church, Kent,
       which was loose, and had another inscription on the back in
       the same manner.</p>

    <p class="note">"I am very much impressed with the idea that
    the destroyed brasses never had been used at all; but had been
    engraved, and then, from circumstances that of course we cannot
    hope to fathom, thrown on one side till the metal might be used
    for some other purpose. This, I think, is a more probable, as
    well as a more charitable explanation than the one usually
    given of the so-called palimpsest brasses."]</p>

    <p><i>Chapels</i> (No. 20. p. 333.).&mdash;As to the origin of
    the name, will you allow me to refer Mr. Gatty to Ducange's
    <i>Glossary</i>, where he will find much that is to his
    purpose.</p>

    <p>As to its being "a legal description," I will not undertake
    to give an opinion without a fee; but I will mention a fact
    which may assist him in forming one. I believe that fifty years
    ago the word <i>Chapel</i> was very seldom used among those who
    formed what was termed the "Dissenting Interest;" that is, the
    three "denominations" of Independents, Baptists, and
    Presbyterians. But I well recollect hearing, from good
    authority, nearly, or quite, forty years ago, that an eminent
    barrister (whom I might now describe as a late learned judge),
    who was much looked up to by the dissenters as one of their
    body, had particularly advised that in all trust-deeds relating
    to places of dissenting worship, they should be called
    "Chapels." I do not know that he assigned any reason, but I
    know that the opinion was given, or communicated, to those who
    had influence; and, from my own observation, I believe that
    from about that time we must date the adoption of the term,
    which has now been long in general use.</p>

    <p>I do not imagine that there was any idea of either
    assistance or opposition to the Church of England, in the mind
    of him who recommended, or those who adopted, the alteration,
    or that either of them expected or sought any thing by this
    measure but to obtain a greater security for property, or,
    rather, to avoid some real or imagined insecurity, found or
    supposed to attach to the form of description previously in
    use.</p>

    <p><i>Loscop</i> (No. 20. p. 319).&mdash;To be "Louecope-free"
    is one of the immunities granted to the Cinque Ports in their
    charters of Liberties.</p>

    <p>Jeakes explains the term thus:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"The Saxon word Cope (in Low Dutch still Kope or Koope),
        for trade or merchandising, makes this as much as to trade
        freely for love. So that by no kind of monopoly patent, or
        company or society of traders or merchants, the portsmen be
        hindered from merchandising; but freely and for love, be
        permitted to trade and traffick, even by such company of
        merchants, whenever it shall happen their concerns lie
        together."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>In my MSS., and in the print of Jeakes, it is "Louecope,"
    with which "Lofcope" may be readily identified; and <i>f</i>
    may easily be misread for <i>s</i>, especially if the roll be
    obscured.</p>

    <p>If Jeakes's etymology of the word be correct, the inference
    would rather be that "Lovecope" was a tax for the goodwill of
    the port at which a merchant vessel might arrive; a "port duty"
    in fact, independent of "lastage" &amp;c., chargeable upon
    every trader that entered the port, whatever her cargo might
    be. And the immunities granted to the portsmen were that they
    should be "port duty free."</p>

    <p>I do not venture to offer this as any thing more than a mere
    guess. Among your contributors there are many more learned than
    myself in this branch of antiquarian lore, who will probably be
    able to give a more correct interpretation, and we shall feel
    obliged for any assistance that they can give us in elucidating
    the question.</p>

    <p>"Lovecope" might perhaps be the designation of the
    association of merchants itself, to which Jeakes alludes; and
    the liberty of forming such association, with powers of
    imposing port duties, may have been dependent on special grant
    to any port by royal charter, such as that which forms the
    subject of your correspondent's communication.</p>

    <p>After all, perhaps, "Lovecope" was the word for an
    association of merchants; and "Louecope-free" is to be freed
    from privileged taxation by this body.</p>

    <p><i>Passage in Frith's Works</i> (No. 20. p. 319).&mdash;This
    passage should be read, as I suppose, "Ab inferiori ad suum
    superius confuse distribui."</p>

    <p>It means that there would be confusion, if what is said
    distributively or universally of the lower, should be applied
    distributively or universally to the higher; or, in other
    words, if what is said universally of a species, should be
    applied universally to the genus that contains that and other
    species: <i>e.g.</i>, properties that are universally found in
    the human species will not be found universally in the genus
    Mammalis, and universal properties of Mammalia wil not be
    universal over the animal kingdom.</p>

    <p><i>Martins, the Louvain Printer</i>.&mdash;Your
    correspondent "W." (No. 12. p. 185.) is informed, that in
    Falkenstein's <i>Geschichte der Buchdrucherkunst</i> (Leipzig,
    1840, p. 257.), Theoderich Martens, printer in Louvain and
    Antwerp, is twice mentioned. I have no doubt but this is the
    correct German form of the name. Mertens, by which he was also
    known, may very possibly be the Flemish form. His Christian
    name was also written Dierik, a short form of Dietrich, which,
    in its turn, is the same as Theodorich.</p>

    <p><i>Master of the Revels</i>.&mdash;"DR. RIMBAULT" states
    (No. 14. p. 219.), that Solomon Dayrolle was appointed Master
    of the Revels in 1744, but does not know the date of his
    decease. It may be unknown to Dr. Rimbault, that Solomon
    Dayrolle<i>s</i> was an intimate friend and correspondent of
    the great Lord Chesterfield: the correspondence continues from
    1748 to 1755 in the selection of Chesterfield's letters to
    which I am referring.</p>

    <p>Dayrolles, during all that period, held a diplomatic
    appointment from this country at the Hague. See Lord
    Chesterfield's letter to him of the 22d Feb. 1748, where Lord
    C. suggests that by being cautious he (Dayrolles) may be put
    <i>en train d'&ecirc;tre Monsieur l'Envoye</i>.</p>

    <p>In several of the letters Chesterfield warmly and familiarly
    commends his hopeful son, Mr. Stanhope, to the care and
    attention of Dayrolles.</p>

    <p>I have not been able to ascertain when Dayrolles died, but
    the above may lead to the discovery.</p>

    <p><i>French Maxim</i>.&mdash;The French saying quoted by
    "R.V." is the 223rd of <i>Les R&eacute;flexions morales du Duc
    de la Rochefoucauld</i> (Pougin, Paris, 1839). I feel great
    pleasure in being able to answer your correspondent's query, as
    I hope that my reply may be the means of introducing to his
    notice one of the most delightful authors that has ever yet
    written: one who deserves far more attention than he appears to
    receive from general readers in this degenerate age, and from
    whom many of his literary successors have borrowed some of
    their brightest thoughts. I need not go far for an
    illustration:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Praise undeserved, is scandal in disguise,"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>is merely a condensation of,</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Louer les princes des vertus qu'ils n'ont pas, c'est
        leur dire impun&eacute;ment des injures."&mdash;La
        Rochefoucauld, Max. 327.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>I believe that Pope marks it as a <i>translation&mdash;a
    borrowed thought&mdash;not as a quotation</i>. He has just
    before used the words "your Majesty;" and I think the word
    "<i>scandal</i>" is employed "<i>consulto</i>," and alludes to
    the offence known in English law as "scandalum magnatum." Your
    correspondent will, of course, read the work in the original;
    in fact, he <i>must</i> do so <i>per force</i>. A good
    translation of <i>Les Maximes</i> is still a desideratum in
    English literature. I have not yet seen one that could lay
    claim even to the meagre title of mediocrity; although I have
    spared neither time nor pains in the search. Should any of your
    readers have been more fortunate, I shall feel obliged by their
    referring me to it.</p>

    1684.</p>

        <p>"On the one side the majestique House of Bourbon,... and
        on the other side, that of two eminent families which
        endeavour'd their own advancement by its destruction; the
        one is already debas'd to the lowest degree, and the other
        almost reduc'd to nothing." &mdash;p. 3.</p>

    <p>Mickleham, Dec. 10. 1849.</p>

    <p><i>Spur Money</i>.&mdash;Two or three years since, a party
    of sappers and miners was stationed at Peterborough, engaged in
    the trigonometrical survey, when the officer entered the
    cathedral with his spurs on, and was immediately beset by the
    choristers, who demanded money of him for treading the sacred
    floor with armed heels. Does any one know the origin of this
    singular custom? I inquired of some of the dignitaries of the
    Cathedral, but they were not aware even of its existence. The
    boys, however, have more tenacious memories, at least where
    their interest is concerned; but we must not look to them for
    the origin of a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page374"
       id="page374"></a>{374}</span> custom which appears to have
       long existed. In the <i>Memorials of John Ray</i>, published
       by the Ray Society, p. 131., there is the following entry in
       his second Itinerary:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"July the 26th, 1661, we began our journey northwards
        from Cambridge, and that day, passing through Huntingdon
        and Stilton, we rode as far as Peterborough twenty-five
        miles. There I first heard the Cathedral service. The
        choristers made us pay money for coming into the choir with
        our spurs on."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p class="author">East Winch.</p>

    <p class="note">[The following note from <i>The Book of the
    Court</i> will serve to illustrate the curious custom referred
    to by our correspondent:</p>

    <p class="note">"In <i>The Privy Purse Expenses of King Henry
    VIII.</i> edited by Sir Harris Nicolas, there occur several
    entries of payments made to the choristers of Windsor 'in
    rewarde for the king's spurs'; which the editor supposes to
    mean 'money paid to redeem the king's spurs, which had become
    the fee of the choristers at Windsor, perhaps at installations,
    or at the annual celebration of St. George's feast.' No notice
    of the subject occurs in Ashmole's or Anstis's <i>History of
    the Order of the Garter</i>. Mr. Markland, quoting a note to
    Gifford's edition of Ben Jonson, vol. ii. p. 49., says, 'In the
    time of Ben Jonson, in consequence of the interruptions to
    Divine Service occasioned by the ringing of the spurs worn by
    persons walking and transacting business in cathedrals, and
    especially in St. Paul's, a small fine was imposed on them,
    called "spur-money," the exaction of which was committed to the
    beadles and singing-boys.' This practice, and to which,
    probably, the items in Henry's household-book bear reference,
    still obtains, or, at least, did till very lately, in the
    Chapel Royal and other choirs. Our informant himself claimed
    the penalty, in Westminster Abbey, from Dr. Fisher, Bishop of
    Rochester, and received from him an eighteenpenny bank token as
    the fine. He likewise claimed the penalty from the King of
    Hanover (then Duke of Cumberland), for entering the choir of
    the Abbey in his spurs. But His Royal Highness, who had been
    installed there, excused himself with great readiness, pleading
    'his right to wear his spurs in that church, inasmuch as it was
    the place where they were first put on him!'&mdash;See further,

    <p><i>Macaulay's Young Levite.</i>&mdash;I met, the other day
    with a rather curious confirmation of a passage in Macaulay's
    <i>History of England</i>, which has been more assailed perhaps
    than any other.</p>

    <p>In his character of the clergy, Macaulay says, they
    frequently married domestics and retainers of great
    houses&mdash;a statement which has grievously excited the wrath
    of Mr. Babington and other champions. In a little book, once
    very popular, first published in 1628, with the title
    <i>Microcosmographie, or a Piece of the World discovered</i>,
    and which is known to have been written by John Earle, after
    the Restoration Bishop of Worcester and then of Salisbury, is
    the following passage. It occurs in what the author calls a
    character of "a young raw preacher."</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"You shall know him by his narrow velvet cape and serge
        facing, and his ruffe, next his hire, the shortest thing
        about him.... His friends, and much painefulnesse, may
        preferre him to thirtie pounds a yeere, and this meanes, to
        a chamber-maide: with whom we leave him now in the bonds of
        wedlocke. Next Sunday you shall have him againe."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The same little book contains many very curious and valuable
    illustrations of contemporary manners, especially in the
    universities.</p>

    <p>That the usage Macaulay refers to was not uncommon, we find
    from a passage in the <i>Woman-Hater</i>, by Beaumont and
    Fletcher (1607), Act III. Sc. 3.</p>

    <p>Lazarillo says,</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year. For example:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
